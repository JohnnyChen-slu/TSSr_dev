Title: TSS sequencing data analysis
Description: TSSr package provides a comprehensive workflow on TSS data starts from 
    identification of accurate TSS locations, clustering TSSs within small genomic 
    regions corresponding to core promoters, and transcriptional activity quantifications, 
    as well as specialized downstream analyses including core promoter shape, cluster 
    annotation, gene differential expression, core promoter shift. TSSr can take 
    multiple formats of files as input, such as Binary Sequence Alignment Mao (BAM) 
    files (single-ended or paired-ended), Browser Extension Data (bed) files, BigWig 
    files, ctss files or tss tables. TSSr also generates various types of TSS or core 
    promoter track files which can be visualized in the UCSC Genome Browser or Integrative 
    Genomics Viewer (IGV). TSSr also exports downstream analyses result tables and plots. 
    Multiple cores are supported on Linux or Mac platforms.
